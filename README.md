Weather App

This project is a dynamic Weather Application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It fetches real-time weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API and displays current
weather conditions for any city. The app provides a clean interface, with support
for temperature unit toggling between Celsius and Fahrenheit.
